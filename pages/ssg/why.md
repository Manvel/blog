Nowdays there are a lot of static site generators(SSGs) as you can see from the
<a href="https://www.staticgen.com/" target="_blank">staticgen.com</a> and
<a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net/" target="_blank">staticsitegenerators.net</a>
lists and yet developers are creating more and more. Here are couple of reasons
why you might want to choose SSG over classic Blog/Website CMS:

### Security

If you have experienced a hack of your traditional CMS installation(like Drupal,
Wordpress and etc) after you have stopped maintaining it for a while, or forgot
to update it, then you know what I'm talking about. As you can see from [current
twitter hashtag thread](https://twitter.com/hashtag/drupalgeddon) security
breaches are happening quite often in such complex installations and a constant
maintenance is required for them, if you haven't updated your installation for a
while, please do it.

### Free hosting

There are nowdays a lot of ways how you can host your static website:

- <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>
- <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/product/pages/" target="_blank">Gitlab pages</a>
- <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>

Those tools also provide you with a free SSL Certificate using
<a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank">Let's Encrypt</a>. So nowdays
there is no reason of having a non encripted website, getting an SSL certificate
issued is just a one free checkbox away.

### Fast

SSGs are generating HTML pages, so they can be requested right away - no dynamic
content generation or database calls are required. In addition free hostings
mentioned above are taking care of your website http caching. So things are
getting as fast as they could be.
