Nowdays there are a lot of static site generators(SSG) as you can see from the
[staticgen.com](https://www.staticgen.com/) and
[staticsitegenerators.net](https://staticsitegenerators.net/) lists and yet
developers are creating more and more. Here are couple of reasons why you might
like to choose SSG over classic Blog/Website CMS:

### Security

If you have experienced the hack of your traditional Drupal, Wordpress and/or
any other CMS install after you stopped maintaining it or updating then you know
what I'm talking about. Going through [current twitter
hashtag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/drupalgeddon) you can see how often that
happens and you need constatly take care of your installation, if you haven't
done it for a while, please do it(hope you don't need to reinstall platform and
do bunch of backups).

### Free hosting

There are nowdays a lot of ways how you can host your static website:

- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Gitlab pages](https://about.gitlab.com/product/pages/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

Those tools also provide you free SSL Certificate using [Let's
Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), no need to buy and/or install the
certificate on your own and renewing it. So nowdays there is no reason of having
non encripted websites, getting a SSL certificate issued is just a one checkbox
away.

### Fast

SSGs are generating HTML pages, no dynamic content generation, database calls
and etc. In addition the free hostings are taking care of your website http
caching. So things are as fast as they could be.

**Note:** Current blog itself is created using Static Site Generator called
CMintS. [Learn more about CMintS](https://cmints.io/).
