2020 was a pretty emotional and tough one(I may write about it one day), so I
skipped reviewing it last year. 2021 has started by me being demobilized from
army service and returning to my regular work and things I do the best:

</a>


Comparing the contribution graph to [2019](https://manvel.me/recap/2019), it’s
pretty clear that my contribution rate has changed, but that didn’t affect the
amount. This is caused by the huge priorities shift and goals adjustments. So
let’s dive into the year and see what
those changes are.

## Rewriting CBA

One of the main achievements of the year was the rewrite of the CBA.  After 5
years of break in 2020 I have finally managed to start rewriting the CBA and in
2021 I have managed to finally [launch the complete rewritten version of the
CBA](/projects/cba/rewriting) which include current changes:

- Complete rewrite of the codebase.
- [Modularization using web components](https://github.com/browser-automation/cba-components).
- [Codebase modernization](/projects/cba/rewriting#modernization).
- [Full automated test coverage](/projects/cba/rewriting#automated-tests).
- [Open sourcing the project](https://github.com/browser-automation/cba).
- [Moved chrome-automation.com from slow Drupal instance into a blazing fast
  static website](/projects/cba/rewriting#drupal-to-ssg).
- and more.

Even though this project was one of those, I have planned to put most of the
effort and build a team around it. The development has temporarily been freezed
mid 2021, which has been caused by several factors, but the one that affected it
the most was me switching to the full-time job in a super fast pace startup.

## Leaving Adblock Plus team

[Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/) has played quite an important role in
my life, as I have spent 7.5 years working on the product. Being part of and
having a small role in helping the ad blocking industry grow and make internet
browsing more pleasant for more than hundreds of million users, who can now
enjoy browsing the web with fewer annoying ads, reclaim their right to privacy,
security and browsing freedom. I have made a lot of friends and met people who
played a huge role in my career and development. Joined a company with 18
people, have seen it being grown to several hundred and then left a small
startup of two most popular ad blockers [Adblock and Adblock Plus joined
forces](https://blog.getadblock.com/teaming-up-to-make-more-magic-5ffa41416dcf).
This was an amazing and insightful journey that changed my life, not only helped
me be part of an important mission, but also helped me move to a new country,
made my digital nomad dream come true and never left me alone, being next to my
family when I was mobilized at the time my country has been dragged into a war.

I will ensure to cover my Journey with the Adblock Plus team in a separate post,
that is coming soon.

## Joining Bardeen

After [rewriting CBA](/projects/cba/rewriting), folks from
[Bardeen](https://www.bardeen.ai/) contacted me offering an opportunity to join
their team full-time. This was a very tough decision for me to make, firstly
because I was in a super comfortable spot working part-time on the Adblock Plus
and the rest of the time I was developing my personal projects. That also
allowed me travel, live nomadic lifestyle, but considering that living nomadic
life during a pandemic has become quite stressful activity as a lot of planning
and safety measures are involved, it has become about the time to find a place
to call home for me and my wife, we have decided to pursue path that potentially
can allow both of us trying something new and eventually move to a new location
we both can live safe and comfortable. During the negotiation phase I also got a
very appealing offer from the Adblock Plus team, but I have finally made a very
tough decision in favor of [bardeen.ai](https://www.bardeen.ai/) due to a
simpler path to my relocation goal, new opportunities and interesting
challenges.

### Team

Bardeen is a very young, developer centric company. [8 out of 10
employees](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?currentCompany=%5B%2266893781%22%5D&origin=COMPANY_PAGE_CANNED_SEARCH&sid=Q)
are developers, while both CEO and CTO are also doing development alongside
other Devs. All of the developers are quite unique in their approaches and
skills filling each other’s gap. We also have a rockstar marketer and super
professional UI/UX designer. Every single person in the team is quite talented
and super nice to each other, which is not always the case when you put a bunch
of ambitious and talented people into the same room.

### Pace

The results Bardeen team has achieved so far surprised me a lot when I was first
approached by the CEO of the company. Since I have joined the company the whole
product has almost been  revisited in terms of architecture, design and user
experience. I haven’t experienced such a pace in development, not in the Adblock
Plus team, nor in any other project/company I used to work for.

### Achievements

At Bardeen I am responsible for the
[scraper](https://www.bardeen.ai/use-case/scraper) functionality, which is the
most used feature of the product, since I have joined the team scraper was
working very unreliable due to the fast development pace, no quality assurance
and website specific implementations, each new feature or bug fix could have
broke the scraper and we kept patching things so the product wouldn’t fall
apart, nowadays Scraper has become quite stable part of the Bardeen working
reliable over every website on the web, there are still room for the
improvement, but at least those improvements wouldn’t cause much of regressions.

Since I have joined the team, here are my small achievements:

- Lead development of the scraper functionality.
- Developed e2e tests infrastructure to be used along the whole product.
- Introduced integration and unit tests targeting scraper functionality.
- Also contributed to:
  - Server side.
  - Buildtools.
  - CI/CD.
  - Frontend.
  - Playbooks
  - and engine.
- Started working with some mainstream tools like React and TypeScript.

### 6 Month stats

Looking into my contributions for Jun 30 - Dec 11 period:

<img src="/images/analytics/github-bardeen-2021.jpg" class="full-width">

- More than 350 commits
  - ~45000 lines added
  - More than 32000 lines deleter
- More than 140 PRs created
- ~107 issues closed

In addition to code contributions, my regular week includes:
- User support(chat, video calls and screencasting).
- At least 8 meetings per week.
- Reviews
- Documenting
- issue reporting

All of that led me working outside my regular work schedule and over the
weekends for the past several months unfortunately, in order to meet deadlines,
expectations and constant requests.

### Future of Bardeen

Even though it was quite tough to keep the crazy pace, I do believe that Bardeen
will be quite a successful product and you will probably hear about the product
in 2022, not only by reading this post, but it will be all over the media. There
are quite a lot of challenges ahead, coming with the rapid user growth(which
will inevitably happen), [pressure on moving to manifest
v3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/mv2-sunset/) by Chrome and
more. But seeing what was possible to achieve in such a short timeframe I think
we have all the prerequisites to win 2022 and hopefully the team will be able to
keep/find a healthy work life balance for the long run.

## Croatia

Being a digital nomad is quite awesome, but nowadays it involves a lot of travel
planning and pandemic doesn’t help with it at all, especially when me and my
wife are holding different passports. Thankfully there are countries who provide
special types of visa to people like us who use modern communication
technologies to do their business. Croatia is one of those countries who has
introduced [Digital Nomad
visa](https://mup.gov.hr/aliens-281621/stay-and-work/temporary-stay-of-digital-nomads/286833)
lately. It took us a week to do the research, collect documents and apply for
the visa in late August and in September we moved to a beautiful city called
Split, which exceeded all our expectations, so me and my wife now can relax a
bit from the logistics, travel planing fatigue and slow down a bit.
