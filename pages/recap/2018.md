2018 was quite productive as you can see from the screenshots below:

<h2><a href="https://cmints.io/" target="_blank">CMintS</a></h2>

Beginning of the year I have started developing a Static Site Generator.
Currently there are [bunch of static site
generators](https://www.staticgen.com/), but the problem with almost all of them
is that, they don't provide complete i18n support out of the box, some of them
do have limited i18n capabilities, for example ability to use translation
strings in the Layouts, but usually not in the pages, also they don't come with
the TMS integration out of the box. Being frustrated by that I [have spent most
part of my weekends and evenings developing CMintS](https://cmints.io).
Currently it's almost ready for the release, only some documentation is missing,
which I hope to complete and make the launch in next 1 or 2 months.

## Talks

Doing a lot of i18n and l10n related stuff both during my full-time job and
while developing [CMintS](https://cmints.io), I have started making a [slide
documentation](https://cmints.io/en/presentation) for references. I had a
chance to present slides, talk about internationalization and localization
during [Dev Days Vilnius](https://devdays.lt/manvel-saroyan/) and BarCamp EVN'
18. You can find [slides here](https://cmints.io/en/presentation), or by sliding
them below:

## Blog

Finally I have managed to pull my blog off, apparently the hardest part was
choosing the domain name, but it has escalated easily after a poll creation and
with the help of my friends.

The blog itself is created using [CMintS](https://cmints.io) and published using
[Netlify](https://cmints.io/en/documentation/getting-started/deployment#netlify). In case someone would like to reuse the Theme and my blog code, you can find everything you need for that [in my github profile](https://github.com/Manvel/blog).


## Fuck Yeah

Conclusion of the year was basically by making a silly project, which apparently
was quite successful by looking through the 2 days result:

<img src="/images/analytics/fyeah-29-12-2018.jpg" class="full-width">

- **10 000+** clicks
- **30+** countries
- **1000+** Page views

The project itself was built with [CMintS](https://cmints.io) and published
using
[Netlify](https://cmints.io/en/documentation/getting-started/deployment#netlify).
You can also find [source code
here](https://github.com/Manvel/fuck-yeah-button), so it's basically an open
source Fuck Yeah Button :)

You can find actual [Fuck Yeah button here](https://fuckyeahbutton.org/) and
read the [story behind the button
here](https://manvel.me/projects/fuck-yeah-button) or you can just chill and hit
