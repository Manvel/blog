In 2012 I was working for a matchmaking company as a developer in the online
marketing department, as part of my regular task was affiliate tracking pixels
installation and as we didn't have a dedicated QA I should manually test each
single of them going through 4-5 steps of validation forms. Somtimes that would
occupy **40-50%** of my time and was quite frustrative task. That was the time when
I decided to create CBA - a prototype extension that helped me optimizing the
task to only take less than 5% of my time and generate automated reports.

It was quite similar to one of the first videos I have created mid 2012 for
promoting CBA on a random matchmaking website:

Since then I was searching for various usecases and enjoying fighting bot
circumvantions, basically I have managed to create a script that would go to
social networks congratulate my friends with birthday, like various posts in
groups, newsfeed, visit various profiles and eventually what was more important
for me is automating matchmaking, as I wasn't a popular kid and it requires me
more effort than for others.

Hackathons participations and social media activity brought a small fame to the
project back in the time, which I really enjoyed and gave me some confidence
which I was lacking back in the time.

## recession and expansion

I have switched my job in 2013 and as I couldn't integrate CBA in the processes
I was busy with, I have stopped actively maintaining the project. Unfortunatelly
such projects require active mainatinance, first the Facebook liking
functionality went down and instead of playing cat and mouse game with Facebook
I have decided to remove the automation script, later the recording started to
work unreliable as the web was evolving and I was at the time busy developing
Adblock Plus, so I decideded just remove the functionality as the code at that
point was barely maintainable and each small change providing a regression. At
that time I was getting a lot of emails from my users and as a result I have
stopped maintaining project in 2015.

Interesting enought - while the extension quality were going down the user count
were going up. As you can see from the current graph:
