## Avatar pic?

<img src="images/authors/manvel.png" width="100px"> I have this guy as my avatar
profile pic since the early ages of ICQ. It's a character from the cartoon
series called [Masyanya](http://www.mult.ru/main/english-version/). I was
watching the series since the early ages of the show, which was 2001. Even
though I didn't catch up with the series for quite a while I have created a
bound with this dude as my avatar pic.

## In real life

<img src="images/authors/menno.png" width="100px"> In real life I look something like
this, most of the time I sit either in my cave or in some cafe working on
another project, basically I love building stuff. The project I work on can be
anything, starting from a Privacy Explanatory Plugin, Automation tool, to CMS or
just Fuck Yeah Button.
