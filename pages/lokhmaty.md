## Avatar pic?

<img src="images/authors/manvel.png" width="100px"> I have this guy as my avatar
profile pic since the early ages of ICQ. It's a character from the cartoon
series called [Masyanya](http://www.mult.ru/main/english-version/). I was
watching the series since the early ages of the show, which was 2001. Even
though I didn't catch up with the series for quite a while I have built a bound
with this dude as my avatar pic. In real life I look like [this guy](/about).
