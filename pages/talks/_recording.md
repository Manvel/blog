### Process of recording

<img src="/images/talks/blanket-choice.jpg" class="right" width="250">

Beforehand(around 6 years ago) when I was recording presentations, I always
hated that I couldn't find an easy solution for removing the background from the
camera recording.

Nowadays it's quite easy to achieve a good enough result with a green blanket
and a bright room.

1 months ago, my girlfriend asked me to choose a beach blanket for our south
european trip. First thought was when I saw the photo of the blanket is that I
can experiment with the green screen during our trip.

As I'm traveling a lot, having a proper Green screen installation is a luxury,
but we were lucky enough that the studio apartment we were staying in the
Sitges(a city close to Barcelona) was bright enough to make the experiment with
the beach blanket.
