Around 1.5 year ago, while developing <a href="https://cmints.io/"
target="_blank">CMintS</a> in order to have a reference handbook I've started
collecting information about internationalization. After receiving an invitation
to give a talk during <a href="https://devdays.lt/last-year/"
target="_blank"> DevDays Vilnius 2018</a>, putting all that information together
was the only thing I had to do in order to share them with the first audience.

Intention of current post is to share the presentation and slides with the
world. On the moment of writing current post the presentation slides are only
available in <a href="https://cmints.io/en/presentation"
target="_blank">English</a>, <a href="https://cmints.io/lt/presentation#/start"
target="_blank">Lithuanian</a>, <a
href="https://cmints.io/hy-am/presentation#/start" target="_blank">Armenian</a>
and <a href="https://cmints.io/de/presentation#/start"
target="_blank">German</a>. You can find slides below, <a
href="https://cmints.io/en/presentation" targer="_blank">open in a new
window</a>, or better just jump into <a
href="#presentation-recording">presentation recording section</a> in order to
also have a voice assistance for them:

## Presentation recording

After making slides ready and presenting them to the multiple audiences in
different countries, unfortunately there were no accessible enough video to
share the talk with the world. As a result I have decided to just record the
talk on my own and upload them to the YouTube, with the hope that the slides
and information might be useful for others as well. You can find overview of
each video and recordings below.

### Part 1 (video)

Wrongly localized <a href="https://youtu.be/YpRc79o-QHM?t=73" target="_blank">
dates</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/YpRc79o-QHM?t=123" target="_blank">numbers</a>
and <a href="https://youtu.be/YpRc79o-QHM?t=152" target="_blank">alphabetical 
order</a> can lead into miscommunication, that's something you might want to
avoid when targeting a certain markets. Making things accessible and serving
relevant content to the users is also quite important for the user retention, in
the current video I do cover usage of the <a href="https://youtu.be/YpRc79o-QHM?t=211" target="_blank">
attributes that are quite important for the project internationalization</a> and
some techniques for <a href="https://youtu.be/YpRc79o-QHM?t=283" target="_blank">
serving users more relevant content</a> based on their language preferences
setup in the browser. Creating layouts for the multi-language project might
become surprisingly non-trivial task because of the way different languages
work, for example the direction of the language can require adaptation of the
layout to work both for <a href="https://youtu.be/YpRc79o-QHM?t=413" target="_blank">
left to right and right to left languages</a>. Another challenge for layouting
can be a <a href="https://youtu.be/YpRc79o-QHM?t=582" target="_blank">design
that only take into consideration fixed measures</a>, while some words can be
multiple times longer in one language than in another, taking that into account
when designing a layout can save one from a lot of surprises after importing new
translations into the project. More languages support means
<a href="https://youtu.be/YpRc79o-QHM?t=645" target="_blank">bigger font files</a>,
<a href="https://youtu.be/YpRc79o-QHM?t=719" target="_blank">splitting font
files into smaller chunks</a> is quite important for keeping the project light
and page font rendering process faster. Translating
<a href="https://youtu.be/YpRc79o-QHM?t=832" target="_blank">SEO</a> and
<a href="https://youtu.be/YpRc79o-QHM?t=922" target="_blank">social media
marketing</a> related meta tags will help your project with the growth, provide
better search results and accessible content to your multilingual audience.

### Part 2 (video)

In order to get started with a multi-language project, it's quite helpful to
learn more about <a href="https://youtu.be/NOQ9dgeVOdo?t=331" target="_blank">
common i18n (Internationalization) project structures</a>,
<a href="https://youtu.be/NOQ9dgeVOdo?t=38" target="_blank">translation file
formats</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/NOQ9dgeVOdo?t=64" target="_blank">
translation strings</a>. Also you might want to ensure that the program you are
using to create multi-language website is comprehensive enough to let your
translators be flexible when creating translation strings and minimize the usage
of linguistic hacks that will eventually have a potential to affect the quality
of the text, for example providing simple flexibility of
<a href="https://youtu.be/NOQ9dgeVOdo?t=185" target="_blank">switching link or
markup order</a> in the text can make your translators more happy and
translation quality higher. You might also want to
<a href="https://youtu.be/NOQ9dgeVOdo?t=270" target="_blank">keep some words
(ex.: Brand names) untranslated</a> ensuring that your solution provide ability to
communicate the syntax to the translators in a less error prone way. Nowadays
it's quite popular to <a href="https://youtu.be/NOQ9dgeVOdo?t=354" target="_blank">
use static site generators</a>, but unfortunately very few of
them do consider important internationalization practices, as a result the most
popular way of dealing with multi-language websites is by creating a
<a href="https://youtu.be/NOQ9dgeVOdo?t=392" target="_blank">separate
content/page file for each separate language</a>, which might be fine for the
projects like wikipedia, where the content is different in each different
language, but in order to have a consistent translation that solution is hardly
scalable, that's why <a href="https://youtu.be/NOQ9dgeVOdo?t=467" target="_blank">
development of the CMintS</a> was started instead of going with any of the
popular solutions, even though there are
<a href="https://www.staticgen.com/" target="_blank">so many Static Site
Generators</a> nowdays.
