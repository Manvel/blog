Around 2 years ago when I started working on CMintS in order to have a reference
handbook I have started collecting information about internationalization. As I
was also invited to make a presentation during [DevDays Vilnius
2018](https://devdays.lt/last-year/) putting all that information together was
the only thing I had to do to share that with the first audience.

You can find those slides below, or by <a

the new window </a> (On the moment of writing current post the presentation
slides are available in English, Lituanian, Armenian and
German):

## Video recording

After making slides ready and presenting to the first audience I had also chance
to make several more presentations about internationalization, but
unfortunatelly no accessible enough video to share the talk with the world. As a
result I have decided to just record the talk on my own and upload them to
YouTube, with the hope that the slides and information might be useful for
others as well.

### Part 1

Wrongly localized dates, numbers and alphabetical order can lead into
misscommunication. Making things accessible and serving relevant content to the
users is also quite important for the user retention, in that part I do cover
usage of the attributes that are quite important for the project
internationalization and some techniques for serving users more relevant
content. Creating layouts for the multi-language project might become
surprisingly non-trivial task because of the way different languages work, for
example the direction of the language can require adaptation of the layout to
work both for left to right and right to left languages. Another challenge for
layouting can a design that only take into consideration fixed mesures, it's
quite easy to guess that same words can be multiple times longer in one language
than in another, taking that into consideration when designing a layout can save
one from a lot of surprises after importing new translations into the project.
More languages support means bigger font files, splitting font files into
smaller chunks is quite important for keeping the project light and page font
rendering fast. Translating SEO and SMM related tags will help your project with
the growth, provide better search results and media content. If that's
interesting for you, then you just one click away from that content:

### Part 2

in the 2-nd part of the videos about Internationalization and Localization the
discussion starts with the introduction of the common i18n project structures
including common translation files, translation string structure and general
structure of the multilanguage project. It's important to ensure that the
program you are using to create multilanguage website is flexible enough to let
your translators change tag(for example links) order considering the fact that
the order can be different in various languages. You might also want to keep
some words untranslated(ex.: Brand names) ensuring that your solution provide
that ability to communicate the syntax to the translators. Nowdays it's quite
popular to use static site generators and there are a lot of them, but
unfortunatelly very few of them do consider internationalization and
unfortunately the most popular way of dealing with multi-language websites is by
creating a separate content file for each separate language, which might be fine
for the projects like wikipedia, where the content is different in each
different language, but in order to have a consistent translation that solution
is hardly scalable. That why instead of going with any of the popular solutions
I have started development of the CMintS.

### Process of recording

Beforehand(around 6 years ago) when I was recording presentation, I always hated
the background which were overlaying the actual presentation, that why I was
recording without camera.

Nowdays it's quite easy to acheave a good result with a green blanket and a
bright room.

1 months ago, my girlfriend asked me to choose a beach blanket for our south
european trip. First thought was when I saw the photo of the blanket is that I
can experiment with the green screen during our trip.

As I'm traveling a lot, having a proper Green screen instalation is a luxury,
but we were lucky enough that the studio apartment we were staying in the
Sitges(a city close to Barcelona) was bright enough to make the experiment with
the beach blanket.
