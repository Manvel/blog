Around 2 years ago when I started working on CMintS in order to have a reference
handbook I have started collecting information about internationalization . As I
was also invited to make a presentation during DevDays Vilnius 2018 putting all
that information together was the only thing I had to do to share that with the
first audience.

On the moment of writing current post the presentation slides besides of English
are also available in Lituanian, Armenian and German. You can find the slides
below, or by <a href="https://cmints.io/en/presentation">opening them(slides) in
the new window </a>:

## Video recording

After making slides ready I had also chance to make several more presentations
about internationalization, but unfortunatelly I didn't have accessible enough
video to share the talk with the world. As a result I have decided to just
record the talk on my own and upload them to YouTube, with the hope that the
slides and information might be useful for others as well.

### Part 1

In the first part of the video the discussion is about multi-language websites
creation including topics like Layouting, SEO, Linguistic details, Fonts, SMM
and etc.

### Part 2

In the 2-nd part of the videos about Internationalization and Localization the
discussion is about different aspects of multi-language websites creation
including: different i18n implementations, dealing with word order, fixed terms,
Static Site Generators, CMintS and various resources for creating multi-language
website.

### Process of recording

Beforehand(around 6 years ago) when I was recording presentation, I always hated
the background which were overlaying the actual presentation, that why I was
recording without camera.

Nowdays it's quite easy to acheave a good result with a green blanket and a
bright room.

1 months ago, my girlfriend asked me to choose a beach blanket for our south
european trip. First thought was when I saw the photo of the blanket is that I
can experiment with the green screen during our trip.

As I'm traveling a lot, having a proper Green screen instalation is a luxury,
but we were lucky enough that the studio apartment we were staying in the
Sitges(a city close to Barcelona) was bright enough to make the experiment with
the beach blanket.
