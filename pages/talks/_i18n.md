Around 2 years ago when I started working on CMintS I have also started
collecting information about internationalization in general, to have a reference
handbook and to share the knowledge with the world. As I was also invited to
make a presentation during DevDays Vilnius 2018 putting all that information
together was the only thing I had to do to share with the first audience. After
that I had a chance to make several more presentations about
Internationalization, but unfortunatelly there were never accessible enough
video to share the talk with the world. As a result I have decided to just
record the talk and share with the world on my own. The result is the following:

## Part 1

In current video I'm discussing different aspects of multi-language websites
creation including: Layouting, SEO, Linguistic details, Fonts, SMM and etc.

## Part 2

In the 2-nd part of the videos about Internationalization and Localization where
I discuss different aspects of multi-language websites creation including:
different i18n implementations, dealing with word order, fixed terms, Static
Site Generators, CMintS and various resources for creating multi-language
website.

## Recording the presentation

Beforehand(around 6 years ago) when I was recording presentation, I always hated
the background which were overlaying the actual presentation, that why I was
recording without camera.

Nowdays it's quite easy to acheave a good result with a green blanket and a
bright room.

1 months ago, my girlfriend asked me to choose a beach blanket for our south
european trip. First thought was when I saw the photo of the blanket is that I
can experiment with the green screen during our trip.

As I'm traveling a lot, having a proper Green screen instalation is a luxury,
but we were lucky enough that the studio apartment we were staying in the
Sitges(a city close to Barcelona) was bright enough to make the experiment with
the beach blanket.
