Around 1.5 year ago, while developing [CMintS](https://cmints.io/) in order to
have a reference handbook I've started collecting information about
internationalization. As I was also invited to make a presentation during
[DevDays Vilnius 2018](https://devdays.lt/last-year/) putting all that
information together was the only thing I had to do in order to share them with
the first audience.

On the moment of writing current post the presentation slides are only available
in [English](https://cmints.io/en/presentation),
[Lituanian](https://cmints.io/lt/presentation#/start),
[Armenian](https://cmints.io/hy-am/presentation#/start) and
[German](https://cmints.io/de/presentation#/start). You can find them below, by
<a href="https://cmints.io/en/presentation" targer="_blank">opening them(slides)
in a new window </a> or by just jumping into [presentation recording
section](#presentation-recording) to have also voice assitence for them:

## Presentation recording

After making slides ready and presenting them to the first audience I had also
chance to make several more presentations about internationalization, but
unfortunatelly no accessible enough video to share the talk with the world. As a
result I have decided to just record the talk on my own and upload them to
YouTube, with the hope that the slides and information might be useful for
others as well. You can find overview of each video and recordings below.

### Part 1 (video)

Wrongly localized [dates](https://youtu.be/YpRc79o-QHM?t=73),
[numbers](https://youtu.be/YpRc79o-QHM?t=123) and [alphabetical
order](https://youtu.be/YpRc79o-QHM?t=152) can lead into misscommunication,
that's something you might want to avoide when targeting a certain markets.
Making things accessible and serving relevant content to the users is also quite
important for the user retention, in the current video I do cover usage of the
[attributes that are quite important for the project
internationalization](https://youtu.be/YpRc79o-QHM?t=211) and some techniques
for [serving users more relevant content](https://youtu.be/YpRc79o-QHM?t=283)
based on their language preferences setup in the browser. Creating layouts for
the multi-language project might become surprisingly non-trivial task because of
the way different languages work, for example the direction of the language can
require adaptation of the layout to work both for [left to right and right to
left languages](https://youtu.be/YpRc79o-QHM?t=413). Another challenge for
layouting can be a [design that only take into consideration fixed
measures](https://youtu.be/YpRc79o-QHM?t=582), while some words can be multiple
times longer in one language than in another, taking that into account when
designing a layout can save one from a lot of surprises after importing new
translations into the project. More languages support means [bigger font
files](https://youtu.be/YpRc79o-QHM?t=645), [splitting font files into smaller
chunks](https://youtu.be/YpRc79o-QHM?t=719) is quite important for keeping the
project light and page font rendering process fast. Translating
[SEO](https://youtu.be/YpRc79o-QHM?t=832) and [social media
marketing](https://youtu.be/YpRc79o-QHM?t=922) related meta tags will help your
project with the growth, provide better search results and accessible content to
your multilingual audience.

### Part 2 (video)

in the 2-nd part of the videos about Internationalization and Localization the
discussion starts with the introduction of the common i18n project structures
including common translation files, translation string structure and general
structure of the multilanguage project. It's important to ensure that the
program you are using to create multilanguage website is flexible enough to let
your translators change tag(for example links) order considering the fact that
the order can be different in various languages. You might also want to keep
some words untranslated(ex.: Brand names) ensuring that your solution provide
that ability to communicate the syntax to the translators. Nowdays it's quite
popular to use static site generators and there are a lot of them, but
unfortunatelly very few of them do consider internationalization and
unfortunately the most popular way of dealing with multi-language websites is by
creating a separate content file for each separate language, which might be fine
for the projects like wikipedia, where the content is different in each
different language, but in order to have a consistent translation that solution
is hardly scalable. That why instead of going with any of the popular solutions
I have started development of the CMintS.

### Process of recording

<img src="/images/talks/blanket-choice.png" class="right" width="250">

Beforehand(around 6 years ago) when I was recording presentation, I always hated
the background which were overlaying the actual presentation, that why I was
recording without camera.

Nowdays it's quite easy to acheave a good result with a green blanket and a
bright room.

1 months ago, my girlfriend asked me to choose a beach blanket for our south
european trip. First thought was when I saw the photo of the blanket is that I
can experiment with the green screen during our trip.

As I'm traveling a lot, having a proper Green screen instalation is a luxury,
but we were lucky enough that the studio apartment we were staying in the
Sitges(a city close to Barcelona) was bright enough to make the experiment with
the beach blanket.
