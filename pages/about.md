<img src="images/authors/menno.png" width="200px"> Hi, my name is Manvel, I'm a
software developer, currently living in Cologne, Germany. In real life I look
like the guy on the left, but online [like this](lokhmaty). Currently I'm
developing [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/) Full-time, but the rest of
the time I sit in my cave working on another personal project, I love building
stuff and also making marketing for them. The project choise can be anything,
starting from a Privacy Explanatory Plugin, Automation tool, to CMS or just to a
FuckYeah Button. You can learn more about my projects in the [Projects](/)
section.
