<img src="images/authors/menno.png" width="200px"> Hi, my name is Manvel, I'm a
software developer, currently living in Cologne, Germany. In real life I look
like a guy on the left, but online [like this dude](lokhmaty). Currently I'm
developing [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/) Full-time, but the rest of
the time I sit in my cave working on another personal project, I love building
stuff and also doing marketing for them. The project choise can be anything,
starting from a [Privacy Explanatory Plugin](/projects/privacy-manager),
[Automation tool](/projects/cba), to a [CMS](/projects/cmints) or just a
[FuckYeah Button](/projects/fuck-yeah-button). You can learn more about them in
the [Projects](/) section.
